## Project Description

As part of an initiative to introduce robotics to new members of my student association Galil√©o, I have decided to develop a combat robot that can move and flip over its opponents. The robot is composed of two robots, each equipped with a wireless gamepad. The robot is powered by 2 motors, a receiver module, an Arduino, and a 9V battery. The robot is controlled by a wireless gamepad.

## Materials
- 2 DC motors
- 1 servo motor
- 1 receiver module
- wireless gamepad
- Arduino Uno
- 9V battery
- spare parts
- LED
- driver

## Software
